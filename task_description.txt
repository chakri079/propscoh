 Software  Engineering  -  Coding  Round
 
If  you’re  reading  this,  we’re  excited  to  work  with  you…  
Hello,  hope  you  are  geared  up  for  some  hands-on  work  in  the  coming  round.  So,  here’s  an  
exercise
 
we
 
hope
 
you’ll
 
ﬁnd
 
enjoyable
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
challenging
 
(just
 
how
 
we
 
like
 
it).
 
 We  encourage  you  to  ask  questions  wherever  you  feel  the  need  for  clariﬁcation,  and  to  really  
show
 
oﬀ
 
your
 
creativity
 
the
 
best
 
way
 
you
 
can.
 
Sometimes
 
this
 
means
 
asking
 
uncomfortable
 
questions
 
and
 
being
 
critical
 
with
 
an
 
intent
 
to
 
learn
 
and
 
grow.
  As  a  software  engineer  with  Propsoch  you’d  need  to  be  open  to  both  giving  and  receiving  
honest
 
feedback
 
and
 
excited
 
about
 
growing
 
together.
 
As
 
you
 
approach
 
this
 
exercise,
 
be
 
as
 
honest
 
and
 
articulate
 
as
 
you
 
can
 
be,
 
and
 
don’t
 
shy
 
away
 
from
 
calling
 
us
 
out
 
if
 
there’s
 
something
 
you
 
believe
 
that
 
really
 
needs
 
changing.
  
We  will  build  a  MVP  of  Splitwise  
If  you  haven’t  used  the  Splitwise  app,  do  check  it  out  on  the  play  store or  the  app  store.  Splitwise  is  the  easiest  way  to  share  expenses  with  friends  and  family  and  stop  stressing  
about
 
“who
 
owes
 
who”.
 
Millions
 
of
 
people
 
around
 
the
 
world
 
use
 
Splitwise
 
to
 
organise
 
group
 
bills
 
for
 
households,
 
trips,
 
and
 
more.
  Here  is  what  we’re  expecting  you  do  in  the  time  we  have:  
MVP  Implementation  (  Take  Home):  
-  Design  database  models  for  users,  expenses,  and  balances.  -  Write  APIs  for  creating  users,  adding  expenses,  &  viewing  balances  

Speciﬁcations:  
Users:  1.  User  should  be  able  to  login  &  create  an  account  with  an  email  &  a  password  2.  User  can  set  their  default  currency  3.  Users  can  see  their  proﬁle  and  update  their  email  and  currency  4.  Users  can  delete  their  account   Expenses:  1.  Users  should  be  able  to  add  an  expense.  Each  expense  should  at  the  least  contain  
Name,
 
Value,
 
Currency,
 
Members,
 
Date
 2.  User  should  be  able  to  view,  update  and  delete  expenses  3.  User  should  be  able  to  see  an  activity  log  of  all  expenses  they’re  a  part  of  -  added  by  
them
 
or
 
other
 
users,
 
grouped
 
by
 
current
 
month,
 
last
 
month
 
&
 
custom
 
date
 
range
  Balances:  1.  User  should  be  able  to  view  their  balances  with  all  diﬀerent  users  2.  User  should  be  receive  a  monthly  report  of  their  balances  in  an  email   You  will  write  and  test  APIs  for  some  of  these  use  cases  as  possible  in  the  given  time.  Only  
implement
 
the
 
APIs
 
that’re
 
marked
 
in
 
bold,
 
use
 
the
 
other
 
ones
 
to
 
inﬂuence
 
your
 
schema
 
design.
 
You
 
don’t
 
have
 
to
 
implement
 
an
 
Auth
 
Layer,
 
simply
 
assume
 
that
 
a
 
user
 
ID
 
is
 
available
 
in
 
the
 
API
 
request
 
for
 
now.
 
Additional  Complexities:  
We  will  discuss  and  implement  additional  complexities  after  the  above  problems  have  been  
solved.
 
 
These
 
complexities
 
will
 
be
 
presented
 
to
 
you
 
on
 
the
 
spot
 
and
 
you
 
will
 
have
 
45
 
mins
 
to
 
discuss
 
and
 
implement
 
them.  
How  will  we  conduct  the  interview?  
You  will  have  to  share  your  screen  and  you  can  feel  free  to  document  and  structure  your  
thoughts
 
on
 
a
 
Google
 
Document
 
/
 
Miro
 
Board
 
etc.
 
And
 
in
 
your
 
preferred
 
IDE,
 
implement
 
the
 
DB,
 
Models,
 
Controllers,
 
Services
 
and
 
Integrations
 
if
 
required.
 
 
 
Once
 
you
 
are
 
done
 
with
 
the
 
tasks
 
mentioned
 
above,
 
please
 
share
 
the
 
github
 
link
 
of
 
the
 
repo
 
and
 
the
 
postman
 
collection
 
for
 
testing.
 
You
 
can
 
feel
 
free
 
to
 
use
 
Google
 
/
 
Stackoverﬂow
 
/
 
other
 
documents
 
or
 
blogs
 
or
 
boilerplates,
 
but
 
DO
 
NOT
 
use
 
Gemini
 
/
 
GPT
 
/
 
Llama
 
or
 
other
 
LLM
 
applications
 
to
 
write
 
the
 
code
 
for
 
you.
  
Which  tech  stack  will  we  use?  
Database:  MySQL  /  SQLite  or  any  other  relational  database  Backend:  NodeJS  Boilerplate:  https://github.com/gadfaria/express-sequelize-boilerplate
